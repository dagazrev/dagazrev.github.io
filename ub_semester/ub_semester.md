## MAIA Master at Universit√© de Bourgogne
The overall objective of this first semester is to start from science fundamentals, low-level image, and signal processing and acquisition. Relevant courses in this semester are:

* Applied Mathematics for Medical Imaging
* Software Engineering
* Digital signal processing
* Image Processing
* Medical Sensors

### Image Processing
Relevant work in this semester, besides getting to know the very basics in imaging processing, was poster creation based on a previous chosen research. In my case, I worked in a poster based on brain tissue segmentation. This is where I first read about watershed algorithm. It was kind of new to me at the moment but it was very well explained later in the semester in Italy. The final [poster](https://github.com/dagazrev/dagazrev.github.io/blob/main/ub_semester/research_poster.png) can be seen here:

Based on the [work](https://link.springer.com/article/10.1007/s11517-020-02270-1) of J. Grande-Barreto and P. Gomez-Gil.

### Medical Sensors
Medical Sensors last project was literature review on image processing methods in fMRI, which a little bit challenging since fMRI is not strictly imaging. Final report in paper-style can be [seen here](https://github.com/dagazrev/dagazrev.github.io/blob/main/ub_semester/jesus_gonzalez_pdf_report_corrige.pdf).
