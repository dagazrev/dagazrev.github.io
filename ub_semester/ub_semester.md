The overall objective of this first semester is to start from science fundamentals, low-level image, and signal processing and acquisition. Relevant courses in this semester are:

* Applied Mathematics for Medical Imaging
* Software Engineering
* Digital signal processing
* Image Processing
* Medical Sensors

Relevant work in this semester, besides getting to know the very basics in imaging processing, was poster creation based on a previous chosen research. In my case, I worked in a poster based on brain tissue segmentation. This is where I first read about watershed algorithm. It was kind of new to me at the moment but it was very well explained later in the semester in Italy. The final poster is this one:
