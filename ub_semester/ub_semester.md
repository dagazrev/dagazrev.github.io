# MAIA Master at UniversitÃ© de Bourgogne
The overall objective of this first semester ðŸ‡«ðŸ‡· is to start from science fundamentals, low-level image, and signal processing and acquisition. Relevant courses in this semester are:

* Applied Mathematics for Medical Imaging
* Software Engineering
* Digital signal processing
* [Image Processing](#image-processing)
* [Medical Sensors](#medical-sensors)

## Image Processing
Relevant work in this semester, besides getting to know the very basics in imaging processing, was poster creation based on a previous chosen research. In my case, I worked in a poster based on brain tissue segmentation. This is where I first read about watershed algorithm. It was kind of new to me at the moment but it was very well explained later in the semester in Italy. The final [poster](https://github.com/dagazrev/dagazrev.github.io/blob/main/ub_semester/research_poster.png) can be seen here:

Based on the [work](https://link.springer.com/article/10.1007/s11517-020-02270-1) of J. Grande-Barreto and P. Gomez-Gil.

## Medical Sensors
Medical Sensors last project was literature review on image processing methods in fMRI, which a little bit challenging since fMRI is not strictly imaging. Final report: Image Processing Methods in functional magnetic resonance imaging - Literature Review in paper-style can be [seen here](https://github.com/dagazrev/dagazrev.github.io/blob/main/ub_semester/jesus_gonzalez_pdf_report_corrige.pdf).

> Abstract
>
> functional and structural magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI and MRI) are great tools to provide both an anatomic view and
a dynamic response of brain response to certain type of stimulus. While MRI provides a great view of the brain as a physical structure,
fMRI compliments this imaging technique by adding an in-depth view of the dynamics in the region of interest. Naturally, it canâ€™t be as
straight as it sounds, since major challenges need to be addressed in order to present reliable data. A review of variations of a core method
called inter-subject correlation ISC are presented here to contrast traditional methods used for segmentation in brain activity, this methods
are Functional Segmentation Analysis of ISC FuSeIsc and Inter-Subject Functional Correlation ISFC. When it comes to methods that use
Deep Learning approaches, the tools are completely different since the idea is to semi automatize the process of diagnose. For instance,
a comparison between two neural networks is presented: Convolutional Neural Networks and autoencoders. Both aiming to diagnose
patients with schizophrenia, using the control group to compare. Then at the end, a comparison/discusion about the two types of methods
is presented.
