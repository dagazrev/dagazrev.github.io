# Welcome
Hello there ! I'm David, a systems engineer, currently enrolled in the Erasmus mundus joint master degree in Medical Imaging And Applications student, or as people prefer to call it: MAIA MsC student. Here you can see briefly my work done so far, don't hesitate in having a look and contacting me.

## My work during the MAIA master
First, let's speak a bit about MAIA. From their [website](https://maiamaster.udg.edu/) they say:
<dl>
<dd>The MAIA (Joint Master Degree in MedicAl Imaging and Applications) master is a 2 years’ joint master degree (120 ECTS) coordinated by the University of Girona (UdG, Spain) and with the University of Bourgogne (uB, France) and the Università degli studi di Cassino e del Lazio Meridionale (UNICLAM, Italy) as partners. The master is structured in four semesters: in the first semester, students study in uB the introductory subjects on image processing and medical imaging, in the second semester they all move to UNICLAM for acquiring knowledge on more advanced subjects in computer vision and pattern recognition. In the third semester, students visit UdG for more applied modules on computer-aided diagnosis and medical applications. Finally, during the fourth semester, students develop their master thesis in any of the universities of the consortia or collaborating institutions (research centers, universities, or companies) working in the field of medical imaging and its applications.</dd>

### My work in the Université de Bourgogne Semester:
The overall objective of this first semester is to start from science fundamentals, low-level image, and signal processing and acquisition. Relevant courses in this semester are:
* Applied Mathematics for Medical Imaging
* Software Engineering
* Digital signal processing
* Image Processing
* Medical Sensors

Relevant work in this semester, besides getting to know the very basics in imaging processing, was poster creation based on a previous chosen research. In my case, I worked in a poster based on brain tissue segmentation. This is where I first read about watershed algorithm. It was kind of new to me at the moment but it was very well explained later in the semester in Italy. The final poster is this one:
