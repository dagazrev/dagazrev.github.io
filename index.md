# Welcome !
Hello there ! I'm David, a systems engineer, currently enrolled in the Erasmus Mundus Joint Master Degree in Medical Imaging And Applications student, or as people prefer to call it: MAIA MsC student. Here you can see briefly my work done so far, don't hesitate in having a look and contacting me.

## MAIA Master
First, let's speak a bit about MAIA. From their [website](https://maiamaster.udg.edu/) they say:
<dl>
<dd>The MAIA (Joint Master Degree in MedicAl Imaging and Applications) master is a 2 years’ joint master degree (120 ECTS) coordinated by the University of Girona (UdG, Spain) and with the University of Bourgogne (uB, France) and the Università degli studi di Cassino e del Lazio Meridionale (UNICLAM, Italy) as partners. The master is structured in four semesters: in the first semester, students study in uB the introductory subjects on image processing and medical imaging, in the second semester they all move to UNICLAM for acquiring knowledge on more advanced subjects in computer vision and pattern recognition. In the third semester, students visit UdG for more applied modules on computer-aided diagnosis and medical applications. Finally, during the fourth semester, students develop their master thesis in any of the universities of the consortia or collaborating institutions (research centers, universities, or companies) working in the field of medical imaging and its applications.</dd>
